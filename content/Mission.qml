This is a UI file (.qml) that is intended to be edited in Qt Design Studio only.
It is supposed to be strictly declarative and only uses a subset of QML. If you edit
this file manually, you might introduce QML code that is not supported by Qt Design Studio.
Check out https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-quick-ui-forms.html for details on .qml files.
